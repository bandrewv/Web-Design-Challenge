# Web-Design-Challenge
Homework Assignment for Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Process Steps
1) Created the repository and created the 7 HTML files needed for this assignment
2) Began by writing the HTML needed for each of the pages including linkages to each of the pages from each page
3) Reviewed Bootstrap and CSS class sessions and activities for information on each of the elements required
4) Iterated and iterated, checking on the Inspector tool in Chrome to see where the root of my design changes was occuring
5) Set up a very basic look for my site, trying to put in everything required for the assignment
6) Attempted the dynamic sizing elements to varying degrees of success

### Retrospective
This was a difficult assignment for me. I managed to at least put something together in the 10 hours betwee the end
of Saturday class and 11:59:59... I hadn't meant for it to come down to the wire, but I was just stuck until I was
able to go back and review all of the session videos...

What I've turned in is not what I'm fully capable of, but I'm proud that I at least got something respectable turned in...
I did not get as much of the sizing done as I wanted to. And I would have liked to have put something more interesting on
the page than the pre-packaged assignment data, but that will have to happen later on in the class.

Though I was very frustrated at times, I am proud of myself for getting it done.
